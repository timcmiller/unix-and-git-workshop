To verify, run the following command.

```
git --version
```

And you'll see something like this.

### Git Config

Like artists, programmers sign their work. Let's configure Git to sign your commits with your name and email address.

**WARNING:** Before running the following commands, replace `YOUR FULL NAME` and `YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS` with the name and email from [your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/profile).

```
git config --global user.name 'YOUR FULL NAME'
git config --global user.email 'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'
```

Next, run this command to download and install some awesome colors and handy aliases for Git.

```
curl -fsSL http://git.io/7UHtNA | sh
```

We'll go over these later. For now, relish in your victory of making it this far in the setup guide. :tada:

### GitHub

You're on the home stretch now! :racehorse:

Run the following command to download and install some extra Git config that'll make your life easier when using GitHub from the command line.


```
curl -fsSL http://git.io/Fasb | sh
```

### Congratulations!

Time for a frosty beverage. :beers:
